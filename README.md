# Opening the Project
Please open "172A-renewed.pdf" to see the full report for the project.
The analysis is implemented in R using a discrete mortality dataset.
The project calculates actuarial present values, derives premium formulas under different pricing principles, and produces sensitivity analysis through visualization.
To run the project, required R packages are loaded and the mortality data is imported.
All premium calculations and figures are generated using the code provided in the Code Appendix.
